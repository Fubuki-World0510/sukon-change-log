## DEMO MUSIC DETECTION IN CONTEXT MENU


If you want someone to listen to the music you want to share and include them in your message, follow the prompt:
`">song name"`
For example:
I really like the song **">say!fanfare"** by shirakami fubuki, you should try listening to it

### ⚠️ BECAREFUL:
Sukon can currently **only detect one song**, if you try to leave two songs in one message sukon will take the closest one. I will update them later
